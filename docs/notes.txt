This is just a random assortment of notes to keep track of things

-CHIP-8, which was essentially an entire (virtual) "computer" that not only 
included a "CPU", but memory, display, keyboard, buzzer, etc. This meant that 
all "ROMs" were essentially written with this entire "computer" in mind.

-However, Intel 8080 is (obviously) just a CPU and different systems may have 
had very different memory, peripherals, display, etc. Thus, it is likely not 
going to be as simple as making one general-purpose emulator for all 8080-based 
systems.

-Once we have the CPU emulated, we will likely then have to specifically 
emulate different 8080-platforms (with Space Invaders being the most common 
of course).

-Having said that, it is probably worthwhile to decouple as many 
platform-dependent features (like peripherals and display) from the main CPU 
emulator as possible. For now the RAM is coupled with the CPU emulator 
since, although technically RAM is separate from the CPU, it seems to make sense 
to keep it there since it's just a simple array. Though this can change if we 
feel it makes sense.

-For my own enjoyment, and to make testing a bit easier, I plan to write a bare-
bones 8080 assembler to allow making test ROMs easier (so we don't have to 
manually use a hex editor to punch hex opcodes into a binary file haha).
